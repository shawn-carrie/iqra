# Overview

The dli directory contains parallel corpus data for 14 different Arabic dialects in .CSV format extracted from PDFs published by the Defense Language Institute.

It’s not pleasant to have to use language resources prepared by, and for use by, the military. They are full of uncomfortable phrases – the first page of the “Basics” guide has phrases like, _“Stop or I’ll shoot!”_ — and there is very little naturalm everyday conversation.

However, from a data persective, they do hold many advantages:

- Public domain

- Regularly-structured data

- Already OCR with Arabic completely intact (which is quite rare)

- Consistent data across many dialects

- These qualities make it a useful source data corpus.

# Structure

The original data were organized into categories:

- Air Crew
- Basics
- Civil Affairs
- Medical
- Naval Crew
- Public Affairs

Each category is divided into subcategories, which are numbered. The parent category is represented by a letter (A,B,C,M,N,P).

# Data Cleaning

The data have been cleaned extensively - cleaning numbered and tagged by category. Carriage returns and whitespace have been trimmed. 

_Remaining Data Cleaning Tasks:_

- Check & Compare sheets where some records are missing/extra
  - Checked so far: Hassaniya
- Revisit & improve categories

# Copyright Information

The containing data was produced by the Defense Language Institute, a branch of the United States military. As they were  produced by the U.S. government using public funds, they exist in the public domain and are free to use.
